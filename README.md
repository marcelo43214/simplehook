## Installation

To install SimpleHook, use pip. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install simplehook
```

## Usage

Using SimpleHook is straightforward. First, import the library and create a webhook instance with your Discord webhook URL. 

```python
from simplehook import SimpleHook

webhook = SimpleHook('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL')
```

You can then send messages or embeds easily:

```python
# Send a simple message
webhook.send('Hello, Discord!')

# Send an embed
embed = {
    "title": "Sample Embed",
    "description": "This is an example of an embed.",
    "color": 5814783
}
webhook.send(embed=embed)
```

## Examples

### Sending a Message

Hereâ€™s how to send a simple message to your Discord channel:

```python
from simplehook import SimpleHook

webhook = SimpleHook('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL')
webhook.send('This is a test message!')
```

### Sending an Embed

You can also send rich embeds:

```python
from simplehook import SimpleHook

webhook = SimpleHook('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL')

embed = {
    "title": "Embed Title",
    "description": "This is an embed description.",
    "color": 16711680
}

webhook.send(embed=embed)
```

### Asynchronous Usage

If you prefer asynchronous programming, SimpleHook supports that too. Hereâ€™s an example:

```python
import asyncio
from simplehook import SimpleHook

async def send_message():
    webhook = SimpleHook('YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL')
    await webhook.send('Hello from async!')

asyncio.run(send_message())
```
